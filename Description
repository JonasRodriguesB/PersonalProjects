That's my online repository where I can share some personal projects. This file, at this moment, consist in a few begginers projects i've been working on and studying.
On each file you can find the code and a short description about that specific project. I'll try to keep improving them while I'm still studying advanced topics.
Feel free to comment and suggest improvements, that's a great opportunity to keep learning.
